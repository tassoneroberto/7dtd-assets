	Define a buff: <buff [attributes]><modify [attributes]/></buff> 
	
	timeString:
	
		A time string can contain two types of times, a real-time, or a game-time value.
		A real-time value is just a number, example: duration="90" would be 90 real-time seconds
		A game-time value is a number with a trailing 't', example: duration="900t" would be 9 in-game hours.
		
	types:
	
		Types organize buffs and can be used to add/remove immunity to certain effects. Multiple types can
		be specified seperated by a ';':
		
		sickness,disease,armorup,armordown,healthup,healthdown,staminaup,staminadown
		
		built-in buff variables, these update 1 time per second. If you create or name other variables in here
		they will also update 1 time per second, if you need more frequent updates they must be declared in code
		with specific settings:
		
		+water/-water : the time in seconds the entity has been in or out of water
		+radiation/-radiation : the time in seconds the entity has been in or out of radiation
		+starve/+full : the time on seconds the player has been starving or has not been starving
		+thirst/+hydrated : the time in seconds the player has been thirsty or has been hydrated
	
	<buff> attributes:
		id="uniqueName" : Internally used to reference buffs from actions or other buffs
		duration="timeString" : Controlls the duration of the buff. A duration of "0" means the buff will persist 
		                        forever and can only be removed by being debuffed. If no duration attribute is 
		                        present then the buff's duration will be the longest <modify>. 
		                        See definition of a timeString above.
		name="String To Display" : The name of the buff presented to the user in the UI.
		description="Description Of Buff" : The description of the buff presented to the user in the UI.
		icon="buff_icon" : The icon to display
		stack="discard,stack,extend,reset" : Default is "discard". Sets the stacking mode of the buff, if it is applied more than once.
		                               "discard" discards any addition buff of that type (it is ignored).
		                               "reset" will reset the time on the buff
		                               "stack" will stack up to a number specified by "stacklimit".
		                               "extend" will extend the existing buff.
		stacklimit="number" : Controls the maximum times a buff can stack. This is required if stack="stack" is used.
		ondebuff="name" : Specified a new buff to apply when this buff is debuffed.
		onexpired="name" : Specified a new buff to apply when this buff expires.
		castsound="sound" : Plays the specified sound when the buff is applied
		ondebuffsound="sound" : Plays the specified sound when the buff is removed by another buff
		onexpiredsound="sound" : Plays the specified sound when the buff expires
		type="types" : Specifies the buff type for use when a damage() action is present. This will specify
		               the type of damage that is applied.
		hitmask="bodypart;bodypart" : Specifies the required hit location for the buff to be applied.
									  Valid parts: body, head, leftarm, rightarm, leftleg, rightleg
		mutex="name,name,name" : Specifies a list of buffs that, if already applied, will prevent this buff from being added.
		requires="name,name,name" : Specifies a list of buffs that must be present for this buff to be cast
		buffif="condition;condition;condition" : The buff will be cast on an entity if the specified conditions are met
										condition = variable greater value, variable less value, variable lequal value, variable gequal value
		debuffif="condition;condition;condition" : see "buffif"
		actions="action1;action2;action3" : When a buff is applied an optional set of actions can be performed.
		                                    Actions are seperated by ';'.

	Drunkeness: Starts with the DrinkBeer buff, which is triggered by the Beer item each time a beer is consumed.
	
	DrinkBeer has no icon specified so it is invisible to the player, you can use hidden buffs to perform some more
	advanced types of effects.
	
	DrinkBeer increments the "beers" variable. The "beers" variable controls several buffs:
	
	"Buzzed" is cast up to 5 beers, after which the player becomes "Drunk".
	If the player drinks more than 8 beers they become "SickDrunk".
	
	If the player lets SickDrunk wear off they will have a hangover. Drinking during a hangover makes them instantly SickDrunk again.
	
	If the player drinks more than 14 beers they will have alcohol poisoning.
	
	The "MetabolizeBeer" buff will slowly reduce the beer variable.
